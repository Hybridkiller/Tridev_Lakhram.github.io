		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<h2> <u>About me</u>:</h2>
		<p>My name is Tridev Lakhram, Born in GPHC (Guyana Public Hospital Corporation) on 28<sup>th</sup> September, 1998. Resided in Campbellville from birth to age three(3) after which we moved to Enterprise Gardens on the East Coast of Demerara where we currently reside. </p>
		<p>I started school at the tender age of three(3) years old having already learned to read by watching my eldest brother play Pokemon Stadium on the Nintendo 64, and having learned to play chess (no, not checkers, chess) at age four(4) by my eldest brother. I couldn't beat him (obviously) but learning the rules is still an admirable feat.</p>
		<p>My schooling life started at Enterprise Nursery School where I excelled at academics, moved on to Enterprise Primary School and left after my second year as a result of bullying. After Enterprise Primary I attended Apex Education for two(2) years and left because my parents found out I was then unable to write the National Grade four(4) assessment. After leaving Apex Academy I entered Dharmic Rama Krisna to write my exams and attain a public secondary education. After writing my exams I was awarded entry to Saint Joseph's High School, here's where things get wayward.
		<p>I excelled throughout my entire Primary School life just to enter secondary school and fail miserably (not below the fail mark, but relative to prior performance). Regardless I stayed in SJH until my fifth year, but made a decision to revert to form four(4), due to the fact that I was not ready to write <abbr ="Caribbean Secondary Examination Certificate">CSEC</abbr> examinations. I made the decision to tranfer to Apex Academy, yet again, to complete my Secondary Education. I wrote CSEC in May/June 2016 and attained the subjects you would see in the <a href="Experience.html">Experience</a> page.
		<p>Afer my secondary education, my desire was to find a job, find a beautiful damsel and settle down, living happily ever after. <strong>But</strong>, my parents had other plans. They wanted me to further my education to my Bachelor's Degree in whatever field I see fit. I thought about it long and hard, and decided it wouldn't have been such a bad idea, as I had no particular job/career in mind at the time. Thinking about it, I decided to go in the field of Computer Science because I <b>had</b> a passion for coding. Here I am, my second year in, fourth semester, suffering behind the work set forward by my dreaded lecturer, he who shan't be named, creating a website about my life. <b>Enjoy!</b>
