	<p> I pride myself as a wise individual, often times I say to persons that "I'm but a old mind stuck in the sexy body of a young man, with a great sense of humour of course." So I have a lot of personal philosophies which I follow and endorse, although people are relucatant to listen to me because of my age and "Inexperience". Regardless, these are some of my more favoured proverbs and advices which I convey to individuals:</p>
	<br>
		<ol>
			<li> Don't curse a bridge you've crossed, because at that time you crossed it for a reason - I tell this to adults only, because teens and young individuals have a habit of doing foolish things, I'm guilty of that as well, as were you, which leads to my second favourite: </li><br>
			<li> Don't be a hypocrite - This isn't much of a proverb as it is advice. Nobody likes someone who tells you to not do something that they themselves are guilty of doing, with or without your knowledge of them doing it. The words of a hypocrite has no merit whatsoever.</li><br>
			<li> Let sleeping dogs lie - If someone doesn't immediately pose a threat or problem to you, regardless of "freedom of speech" then don't voice your opinions, keep them to yourselves because more likely than not, your opinion will not change the person they are and you will be verbally or physically (or both) threatened.</li>
